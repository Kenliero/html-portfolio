<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Personal Trainer, who has done programming in the past. My dream is to build my own phone app, which provides training program for users. For this I am trying to become Full Stack Developer, so that I can create my own front- and Backend for the app. While doing that, I am trying to master my skills to best possible, so that it will be flawless system. Also, doing so, I am learning programming so well, that I am trying to make it my actual profession as well.</p>

<p>I am living in Finland at the momemt. I have family in Vietnam, where I will move permanently, in 2 years. My goal is to become very good programmer in the next 2 years.
  I am curently using, and I am studying Javascript, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS. In the past I have done projects, using Visual Basic, Delphi Pascal, and also C#, with .NET MAUI and Entityframework Core, when I was tinkering with building phone app and back end. I decided to focus more on Javascript and Python recently. My largest projectg was a game that I made, with Delphi Pascal, many years ago. It was very large project, and took me years. I managed to make it very far, and the game was partially working, but I never go to make internet support for it, back then. It was Space Strategy game, where one could build space ships and fly to planets with them. It created universe, with many star systems, which had planets going around stars, in real time. All the technology was similar to Diablo 2 game at the time, where itemization was very large and advanced. I stopped the project eventually, because it became too large for one person, to finish. I originally started it with Visual Basic, but then converted it to Delphi Pascal. Back then I also studied C++.
